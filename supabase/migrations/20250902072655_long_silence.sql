  # Fix RLS Infinite Recursion Error

  1. Problem
    - RLS policies on user_profiles table are causing infinite recursion
    - Policies are trying to query user_profiles table within their own definitions

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing problematic policies on user_profiles
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies using auth.uid() directly
    - Update other table policies to use auth.jwt() for role checking instead of querying user_profiles

  3. Security Changes
    - Users can only access their own profile data
    - Role-based access will be handled at application level initially
    - Admin access will use service role key for management operations
